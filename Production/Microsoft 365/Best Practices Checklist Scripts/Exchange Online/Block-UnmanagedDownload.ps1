## NOTE: You must implement this policy in conjunction with a corresponding Conditional access policy in Azure AD
## As of today this process cannot be scripted (in a supported way) as Conditional Access is not exposed via the Graph API
## To create the policy from Azure AD > Conditional Access:
## Name the policy "Block attachment download in OWA on unmanaged devices"
## Target the appropriate user groups (or All users)
## Target Exchange Online
## Use the Session Control called "Enforce app restricitons"
## Save and enable the policy
